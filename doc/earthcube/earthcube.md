The S2Cell hierarchy projects the Earth onto six top-level "face-cells",
which may be unwrapped and flattened into a stairstep arrangement. Below
is a map of the six faces:

A single space-filling curve covers the entire globe, snaking from one
face to the next. Note the traversal order in the odd-numbered faces is
the mirror of the order in even numbered faces.

You can print out the following six images on a good color printer, glue
them onto sturdy cardboard squares and tape them together to form a
cube, to make a model S2Cell-Hierarchy Globe, which will let you
visually locate any cell at level 5 or higher.
